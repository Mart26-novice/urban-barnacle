This Java Project was designed and developed as an e-commerce app. This project is somewhat identical to the existing Lazada or Shoppe Online Application, where you can browse or see the available products, provide the name, price, description/specification of the products, and you can add them to the cart - add to cart now! However, I am just inspired by those applications and I do not want to be sued for copyright infringement by the said company. It is just that, my hobby is to manage our small business (or tyangge in Hiligaynon). I am in charge of anything that happens inside and outside of our convenience store. From governing the products, stocks, cleaning, maintaining, selling, and revenue.   The said project is capable of  Creation, Packing, Updating the Stock, Exhibits the Inventory, and a Receipt containing crucial details such as name, price, description/specs, total amount, change, address/location, mode of payment, and time of arrival.   Currently, the program is not ready to operate and it is being progressively developed to further concrete or solidify the function or performance of the project and to serve its beloved customers.   Attached below is the sample snippet out of the project. Please treat this as an example of the probable outcome of the app. More improvement and changes may happen.
